                <p class="reasons-text">BlastOff is a 
                    random stock generator supporting over 100,000 different 
                    stocks, that is provided FOR FREE, for all retail investors. It picks 
                    random stocks, an unlimited amount of times, at the press of a single button. 
                    
                    This tool was inspired by the GameStop (GME) Short Squeeze that
                    occurred in late January 2021. Due to the shutdown of trading on 
                    platforms such as Robinhood, WeBull, TD Ameritrade, Trading212, and more,
                    it became obvious that there is a bias against everyday retail traders.

                <p class="reasons-text">
                    Retail investors need tools at their 
                    disposal that are unbiased, accurate, and easy to use - and thus, 
                    BlastOff was born.

                <p class="reasons-text">
                    BlastOff is NOT a trading platform. It's a trading discovery platform, 
                    designed to bring to attention stocks that users may not have heard of,
                    and present valuable information at a quick glance, saving our users time,
                    and helping them earn money.
                </p>
                <p class="reasons-text">
                    BlastOff is designed to be accurate, but most important,
                    an enjoyable experience to use. Our state of the art 
                    Stock Reel technology allows a fun visual to be displayed while
                    waiting for the next hot stock to be shown. Looking for the stock picks 
                    of tomorrow is no more -- with BlastOff, you can find hot new stock picks, TODAY.

                <p class="reasons-text">
                    On top of this, the inspiration for BlastOff is supported by 
                    many respected investors. A Walk Down Wall Street espouses a tactic 
                    of randomly selecting stocks -- for it's hard for investors to beat the market
                    over time. Our belief is that by providing an educated glance at 
                    each stock encountered during a user's "random walk" through different 
                    tickers on the stock market, they can beat the market and find 
                    diamonds in the rough.
